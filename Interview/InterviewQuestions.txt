QUESTIONS ON C:

1)What is register keyword? On what scenarios is it used?

2)How to free memory without using free() function?

3)How to calculate size of a structure variable without using sizeof() operator?
   
   Ex -  For variable 
   #define sizeof_var( var ) ((size_t)(&(var)+1)-(size_t)(&(var))) 
   
   
4)Can we modify const variables? If yes, how?

5)What are static functions and static variables? Can we have static functions with same name in different .c files? -> Yes

6)What is the difference between a++ and a=a+1 when we think from a assembly level perspective?


7)What is volatile keyword used for? Is it a data storage type?

8)static int a;
static int b = 10;

void func() {
int c;
}

Where are the variables a,b,c stored in RAM?




9) Write a program to add an element at a particular position into an array.

10)Write a program to flip all the bits of a number. -> Not Done

11)Write a program to find length of a string without using strlen() function.

12)Write a program to check if a number is a palindrome or not.



13)

Below are the numbers:
a = 798; b=35
Their linkedlist representation is 8->9->7 and 5->3
Write a program to add these numbers using linkedlist implementation.




14)Explain the memory layout of a C program.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-layout-of-c-program/


15)inline int func()
{
return 2;
}

void main()
{
int b = 0;
b = func();
}

What will happen if we compile the above code?
if anything is wrong, then how do we rectify it?




16)Write a program to reverse a string by using recursive function.

17)What is the difference between malloc() and calloc()?
What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these functions?

18)What is dangling pointer, NULL pointer?

19)What is buffer overflow?

20)What is memory leak, segmentation fault?

21)What is valgrind used for? How do we use it to test our code? 
How should the code be compiled in order to use valgrind?

22)What is the difference between static and dynamic analysis tools?

23)Which section of RAM are pointers stored?

24)Define a function macro that returns true if two memory regions are overlapping
and false if they don't overlap.

25)Explain pointer to const, const pointer with some code snippet.


26)int* func()
{
int b;
int *a = &b;

return a;
}

void main()
{
int *c = func();
printf("%d\n", c);
}

What is the output of the above program?
