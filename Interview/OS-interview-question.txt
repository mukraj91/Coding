Multiprogramming -> Non=preemtive

Multitasking -> Preemtive(Time sharing )


What is multiprogramming? ->

A multiprogramming is a parallel processing in which the multiple programs can run simultaneously.
Multi programming is the ability of an os to execute multiple programs at the same time on single processor machine.




Bootstrap program and where is it stored?->
https://moviecultists.com/where-bootstrap-program-is-stored


A bootstrap program is the initial program that the computer runs when it is powered up or rebooted. 
It initializes all aspects of the system, from CPU registers to device controllers to memory contents. 
Typically, it is stored in read-only memory (ROM) or electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), 
known by the general term firmware, within the computer hardware.


What is bootstrap loader example?
A Bootstrap Loader (BSL) is a small program which can be activated immediately after a microcontroller has been powered up.



Booting Process :- 

The booting process loads the operating system from bootable device
like(Harddisk) into main memory(RAM) installed on your computer.



Power on Switch(CPU) -> Booting Process -> Login Screen

6 Steps of Linux Booting Process

BIOS -> Basic Input/Output System.
         (Execute MBR)
 > Perform Integrity Check(POST -> Power On Self Test) process)
 > Check all the device well connected or not
 > Once all the device check is completed then BIOS search the bootable device.And it will read the firstsector of the bootable device.
 > First sector conatan the information about MBR
 > MBR located in the 1st sector of the bootable disk.
 > Typically /dev/hda or /dev/sda
> Size of MBR(Master Boot Record(512 Byte))
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary Boot Loader(446 Bytes) + Partition Table(64 Bytes) + MBR (2 Bytes) = 512 Byes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


MBR  -> Master Boot Recorder
         (Execute GRUB)

-> Bootable device first sector is called MBR.
-> Once Booloader once search it will GRUB screen will show.




GRUM -> Grand Unified Bootloader
          (Execute Kernel)
> How many operating system has installed u can see in GRUB.
> once GRUM will store the kernel information.

KERNEL -> Kernel(Operating system)
          (Execute sbin/ init
> Kernel mount the root file system.
> Once kernel start its operation is executed.
/sbin/init process


Init  -> Init (systemd)
          (Execute Run level programs)

> Look at the etc/inittab file to decide the linux run level



Run Level -> Run Level program (A run level is a state of init and the whole system that defines what system services are operating.)
            (Execute from /etc/rc.d)

-> Run level decide which initial program are loaded at startup.

init 0  - > Halt ( The system can be safely powered off with no activity.)
init 1  - > Single user mode
init 2  - > Multiuser Mode , Without NFS((network file system).)
init 3  - > Full Multiuser mode (under the command line interface and not under the graphical user interface.)
init 4  - > Unused (User-definable.)
init 5  - > X11 (Multiple user mode under GUI (graphical user interface) and this is the standard runlevel for most of the LINUX based systems)
init 6  - > Reboot (Reboot which is used to restart the system.)


Note:- init is the program responsible for altering the run level which can be called using telinit command
