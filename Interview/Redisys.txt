Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number)
    which has the largest sum and return its sum.
	
	
 
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
 

-2, 1, -3, 4 = 0

1, -3, 4, -1 = 1

-3, 4, -1, 2 = 2

4, -1, 2, 1 = 6

-1, 2, 1, -5 = -3

2, 1, -5, 4 = 2




int main()
{
vector<int>  = {-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4};

int i, j;
int temp = 0
int sum;

for(i = v.begin(); i!= v.end(); i++)
{
   
  for( j = i+1 ; j!= v.end(); j++)
  {
    sum += j;
      
  }
    if(sum < temp)
	{
	  sum = temp;
    }

}

return sum;
}
